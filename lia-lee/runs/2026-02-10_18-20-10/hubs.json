However, without proper soul-calling ceremonies (hu plig) performed by a skilled txiv neeb, the wandering soul could be captured by malevolent spirits (dab), causing deterioration and death. The Western medications presented a serious spiritual problem: they made Lia excessively drowsy, sedated, and 'not herself'—observable evidence that her soul was being pushed further away rather than welcomed home. A child whose vital essence is suppressed cannot have her soul called back. The family performed numerous traditional ceremonies, hired multiple respected txiv neeb from the Hmong community, and sacrificed pigs and chickens to call Lia's souls home. They gave medications inconsistently—sometimes stopping them entirely, sometimes giving partial doses—because they directly observed that heavy sedation seemed to push Lia's soul further away, making her less present, less connected to her family. The family was not opposed to Western medicine categorically; they believed both systems might contribute something. But spiritual treatment addressed the root cause (soul displacement) while Western medicine only suppressed symptoms (the falling episodes) at the cost of suppressing Lia's vital presence."

This condition was spiritually significant: those with qaug dab peg often develop the gift to become txiv neeb themselves. However, without proper soul-calling ceremonies (hu plig) performed by a skilled txiv neeb, the wandering soul could be captured by malevolent spirits (dab), causing deterioration and death. The Western medications presented a serious spiritual problem: they made Lia excessively drowsy, sedated, and 'not herself'—observable evidence that her soul was being pushed further away rather than welcomed home. A child whose vital essence is suppressed cannot have her soul called back. The family performed numerous traditional ceremonies, hired multiple respected txiv neeb from the Hmong community, and sacrificed pigs and chickens to call Lia's souls home. They gave medications inconsistently—sometimes stopping them entirely, sometimes giving partial doses—because they directly observed that heavy sedation seemed to push Lia's soul further away, making her less present, less connected to her family. The family was not opposed to Western medicine categorically; they believed both systems might contribute something. But spiritual treatment addressed the root cause (soul displacement) while Western medicine only suppressed symptoms (the falling episodes) at the cost of suppressing Lia's vital presence."
